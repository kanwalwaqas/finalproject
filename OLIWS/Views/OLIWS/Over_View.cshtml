                            <h2>What is Education?</h2>
                        <p>As we all know, education is important in our life. Education is the only thing that helps us to differentiate what is wrong and what is right. Without education we can’t do what we want or we can’t reach our destination. Education helps us in each and every field of our life.&#8221; &#8211; Qur&#8217;an 9:103.</p>
                        <p>Education helps us to explore our own thoughts and ideas and makes it able to express it in different forms. So for me education is like a medium through which I can interact with different people and share our ideas. It is also the door to our destiny..</p>
                        <p>The first thing that strikes me about education is knowledge gain. Education gives us a knowledge of the world around us and changes it into something better. It develops in us a perspective of looking at life. It helps us build opinions and have points of view on things in life. People debate over the subject of whether education is the only thing that gives knowledge. Some say education is the process of gaining information about the surrounding world while knowledge is something very different.</p>

                    <h3 class="thm-color">Why education is important</h3>


                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Education is the most element in the evolution of the nation. Some people across the world would think that money is an important factor, but it is wrong because without education, no money. Learning is the major factor which is related to education if you learn new things, then you will educate more and more. Without the education you will not explore the new ideas it means you will not able to develop the world because without ideas there is no creativity and without creativity, there is no development. .</p>
                        <p>Across the world, we saw that some country is more germinate and some are not. The country which is more growing the more educated people ratio compares to the country which is less developed. Education is the tool which provides people require knowledge, skill, technique, and information and enables them to know their rights and duties toward their family, society, and obviously nation. Education expands the vision, outlook to see the world.)<br />

                            <h2>Health</h2>
                        <p>Health is something that affects every single living creature on this planet. Preventing illness is often as simple as soap, clean water and hygienic sanitation facilities, and perhaps a piece of netting to protect children from malaria-transmitting mosquito bites. When these basic items are provided, the number of illnesses drops drastically. These are still unattainable luxuries in some regions of the world..</p>
                        <p>But preventing illness is not the only challenge. Once an individual becomes ill, access to health care varies widely: Poor populations tend to have less access to health care. Poor children live much shorter lives than children from wealthy families, in part due to inadequate health care. A boy who was born in 2012 in a high-income country can expect to live 75.8 years—more than 15 years longer than a boy born in a low-income country..</p>

                    <h3 class="thm-color">Health in Islam</h3>


                    <div class="text">
                        <p>
                            The life of this world is not stable.  Every person goes through stages and phases; happiness is followed by sadness and then relief or joy, ones’ faith is strong and unconquerable, and seemingly, for no reason it plummets, next, by the will of God it slowly rises again.  Periods of great fitness and health are followed by injury or, sickness, but with each twinge of pain or suffering a true believer feels some of his sins fall away.<br>

                            <b>“Whenever a Muslim is afflicted by harm from sickness or other matters, God will expiate his sins, like leaves drop from a tree.” (Bukhari and Muslim). </b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>Islam takes a holistic approach to health.  Just as religious life is inseparable from secular life, physical, emotional and spiritual health cannot be separated; they are three parts that make a completely healthy person.  When one part is injured or unhealthy, the other parts suffer.  If a person is physically ill or injured it may be difficult to concentrate on anything but the pain.  If a person is emotionally unwell, he or she may not be able to take care of him or herself properly or find their minds distracted from the realities of life)<br />

                            <p>Lending is one of the highly recommended acts. Emphatic exhortations are related in the Noble Qur’an, the Prophet's Sunnah and the narrations of the infallible Ahlul-Bait, peace be upon them all.</p>
                            <p>It has been related from the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his family (that he said): He who loans a Muslim a loan expecting his good fortune in it, his wealth is (akin to being used as) Zakah and (this deed) is in the prayers of the angels until it is paid. He who needs his Muslim brother for a loan and (his brother) is capable of it and does not provide it, Allah will forbid the fragrance of heaven for him. In another narration, he said, peace be upon him: Charity (Sadaqah) has the reward of ten and the loan (Qardh) has the reward of eighteen.</p>

                            <p>
                                Yes, only if, when you pay off your loan, you are giving back the exact amount that you borrowed.
                            </p>
                            <p>There are Shariah Banks and wealthy individuals who are always willing to give people business and student loans without demanding interest. It is okay to take loans from these institutions. Always be 100% sure you will not have to give or take some form of interest. It can be sneaky: an extra $10 in this payment, this month, a couple of extra cents per day, etc.<br>
